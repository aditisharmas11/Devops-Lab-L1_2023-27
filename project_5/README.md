## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
This is the easiest way to run the full stack, including the MySQL database.
```bash
# Build and start the containers in detached mode
docker-compose up -d --build

# To view logs
docker-compose logs -f

# To stop the system
docker-compose down
```

Open the app at `http://localhost:8081`.

### Manual Setup (Without Docker)
1. Ensure MySQL is running on port `3306`.
2. Create a database named `ayush_retail_db`.
3. Set environment variables or update `application.yml` with your DB credentials.
4. Run the Maven wrapper:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## 🔐 Default Admin Account
When running the application, you can create a user through the Registration page. By default, newly registered users in this development build will be granted the `ROLE_ADMIN` authority to allow full access to the dashboard.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `src/main/java/com/retail/system/`: Java source code (Controllers, Services, Repos, Entities, Security configuration).
- `src/main/resources/templates/`: Thymeleaf HTML templates.
- `src/main/resources/static/css/`: Custom styles (Bootstrap overrides, Sidebar, etc.).
- `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage Docker build file ensuring an optimized, small footprint image.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Container orchestration configuration.
- `Jenkinsfile`: CI/CD pipeline support including build and security scanning stages.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Implemented
